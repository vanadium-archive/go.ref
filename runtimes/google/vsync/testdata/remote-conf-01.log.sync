# Update an object remotely three times triggering a conflict with
# 2 graft points: v0 and v2.  This assumes that the remote sync got
# v0, made its own conflicting v3 that it resolved into v4 (against v1)
# then made a v5 change.  When the local sync gets back this info it
# sees 2 graft points: v0-v3 and v1-v4. 
# The format is: <cmd>|<objid>|<version>|<parent1>|<parent2>|<logrec>|<continued>
